Edit bin/makedeployscripts.template and copy to your development machine on the path.
In the ~/curiousdeploy/certs folder put the wearecurious.crt and wearecurious.key files to be copied to the
Apache certificates folder on the web server.

Each folder is meant to be copied to /root on the server in question and the install script should be run inside bash.

You may run multiple install scripts on the same server, they are designed to set up a fresh CentOS 7 server or
a server that has already had one or more scripts run on it.
