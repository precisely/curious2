 	  <h2>Thank you. Now, go over our guidelines for monitoring and recording your heart rate.</h2>

	  <p>1. <b>Take your resting heart rate before your first cup of coffee of the day.</b>
	  "Resting heart rate" just means you’re sitting still, preferably not breathless from exertion.
	  You can take your pulse for thirty seconds and double it or you can use something like a smart
	  phone app like Heart Fitness for the iPhone. Just be sure to use the same method every day.</p>

	  <p>2. <b>Tweet your heart rate to @trkcs using a private Direct Message:</b><br/>
	  hr 76 bpm</p>

	  <p>If you’re sending a text message via your mobile phone instead of a Twitter client, you’ll have to preface the message with D trkcs so it looks like this:<br/>
	  D trkcs hr 76 bpm</p>

	  <p>3. <b>Drink your first cup of coffee, and tweet to @trkcs using a Direct Message:</b></br>
	  coffee 1 cup</p>

	  <p>4. <b>Wait five minutes, measure your heart rate again, and tweet it to @trkcs using a Direct Message:</b><br/>
	  hr 78 bpm</p>

	  <p>Or text message "D trkcs hr 78 bpm" to Twitter.</p>

	  <p><b>Repeat every day for five days.</b></p>

	  <p>If you have questions or statements of outrage, email us at questions@wearecurio.us. Thanks a million! We’ll let you know what we find. We’ll also let you know as soon as we can offer you a peek at the system.</p>
